I am currently a part of a breast cancer research team where me and my team, under the guidance of a PhD Bioinformatics student, are using machine learning algorithms on gene expression data to classify breast cancer subtypes and analyse how different genes affect the classification of breast cancer. I am very passionate about the process of drawing insights from complex data and always work to better my skills at working with data. Currently, I am looking for an internship role in the data field.\r\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions or just for a chat at blaiseappo@gmail.com.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
